Why would you use this App?

The Story Board app provides your team a view of the stories, defects and defect suites within your iteration organized by schedule state, as if you were looking at a whiteboard.

If you want to grab the App and try it you can find it [here] (https://github.com/RallyApps/StoryBoard/blob/master/deploy/App.html).
